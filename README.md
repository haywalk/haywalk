### Hayden Walker 💾🔧🌐🐧

I'm a computer science student, TA, research assistant, and programmer from New Brunswick, Canada. 

I'm interested in free and open source software, GNU/Linux, system administration, web development, and systems programming. I mainly work in Java and C, but have recently started learning React. My hobbies include competitive programming and ham radio.
